# Global-Waveform-Catalogue

This is the central repository for the Global Waveform Catalogue - a database of earthquakes that have been studied by an analyst and modelled using synthetic seismograms. Most of the earthquakes in this database come from the literature, however there are also a number of solutions that are unpublished.
